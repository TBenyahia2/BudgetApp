The Budget App User Manual

In order to run this app you must have mySql, Tomcat9, and the current jdk. 
The project was built in eclipse for JEE as a general web development project. 

Import the project to your eclipse workspace and running the project from Eclipse is the simplest route. 

A secondary method available for running the app on your own local machine is to place the packaged .war file, the_budget_app.war and placing it in the webapps folder of your root tomcat directory. After about 15-20 seconds the .war should create a webapp package on your local server that can be visited by typing localhost:8080/the_budget_app
